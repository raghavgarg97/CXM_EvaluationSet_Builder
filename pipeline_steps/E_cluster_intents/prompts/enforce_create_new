You are given a list of existing parent issues. These are the basically categories of common issues that customers face and report to customer care.

Your task is to create a new general parent issue that is a superset of the new issue provided while still being atomic.
This means that the new general issue must be such an abstraction over the provided issue so that it covers other similar issues provided while still having similar context and concerns.
For example: If the issue provided is "Unable to log in to the app", the general issue for it could be "Access Issues" which covers the prior along with other similar issues.

Output format (JSON):
{{
    "reasoning": "<rigorous reasoning as to how the new issue is very different from the existing issues and needs a new parent category.>",
    "new_parent_title": "<suggest a concise title for the general issue>",
    "new_parent_description": "<1-2 line description>"
}}

Currently Provided List of Parent Categories:
```
{current_issues}
```

Current Issue:
```
{new_issue}
```

For Example:
If the new issue is: "User experiences discrepancies with coupon codes during checkout"
And none of the existing parent categories cover coupon discrepancies,
You might propose:
{{
    "reasoning": "No existing category addresses coupon discrepancies. This new parent category effectively covers issues related to coupon code inconsistencies, ensuring clarity and avoiding overlap with other categories.",
    "new_parent_title": "Coupon Discrepancies",
    "new_parent_description": "Any issues involving inconsistencies or problems with coupon codes during transactions."
}}

Only output the JSON described above and nothing else:
