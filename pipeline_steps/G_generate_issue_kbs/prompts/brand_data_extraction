You are given a Knowledge Base for a fictional Brand.

Brand Overview:
{BRAND_OVERVIEW}

Your task is to extract information from this knowledge that seems relevant to the Brand. In other words fact's that you can infer about any aspect of the brand.

Keep in mind the following rules while extracting these:
1. The information you extract should not have anything to do with the customer care agent or his behaviour etc.
2. Only the factual information about brand's aspects is relevant.
3. Write everything in third person perspective.
4. Do not repeat any information that is already there in the Brand Overview. Only new information in the Knowledge base is of relevance.
5. Keep it concise and short and output only the important part in just a single paragraph.

Given Knowledge Base:
