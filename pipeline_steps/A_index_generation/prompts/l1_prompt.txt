You are given the overview of a fictional Brand. Given that overview you have to generate more information about one particular aspect of the Brand.

Fictional Brand Description:
{brand_description}

Your task is to generate broad subcategories for {entity_name} of the Brand based on typical retail or service groupings. Include any unique or novel categories that might exist in this field.
Generate such broad subcategories such that they cover all the aspects of {entity_name} and keep the number of subcategories to less than 10.

The definition of {entity_name} is as follows: {entity_desc}
{properties_info}
Output the subcategories in the form a json like below:

{{
    "reasoning": "rigorous reasoning as to what could be the broad and sensible subcategories.",
    "sub_categories": {{
        "sub category name 1": "sub category description",
        "sub category name 2": "sub category description",
        ....
    }}
}}
