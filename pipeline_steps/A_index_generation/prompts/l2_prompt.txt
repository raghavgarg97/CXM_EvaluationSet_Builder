You are given the overview of a fictional Brand. Given that overview you have to generate more information about one particular aspect of the Brand.

Fictional Brand Description:
{brand_description}

Your task is to generate a few (at most {n_subcategories}) subcategories for {entity_name} ({parent_name}) of the Brand based on typical retail or service groupings. Include any unique or novel categories that might exist in this field.

The definition of {entity_name} is as follows: {entity_desc}.
{properties_info}
This entity '{entity_name}' itself is the child of the {parent_name} whose description is: {parent_desc}.

Output the subcategories in the form of a JSON like below:

{{
    "reasoning": "rigorous reasoning as to what could be the broad and sensible subcategories (at most {n_subcategories}) avoiding all the sibling entities.",
    "sub_categories": {{
        "sub category name 1": "sub category description",
        "sub category name 2": "sub category description",
        ....
    }}
}}

You are also given the list of siblings of this entity. Make sure each sub category generated here belongs to this entity only and not any other sibling entity.
List of sibling entities:
{sibling_entities}
{precursor_info}
Output only this json without any markdown or explanation.
