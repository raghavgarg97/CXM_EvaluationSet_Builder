**Role:** You are an AI assistant tasked with information retrieval and action identification based on conversational context.

**Objective:** Analyze the provided Conversation History, Knowledge Base (KB), and available Agent Actions. Your goal is to extract specific information to help an agent formulate their next response.

**Inputs:**

1.  **Knowledge Base (KB):**
```
{kb}
```
2.  **Agent Actions (Skills with Descriptions):**
```
{skills}
```
3.  **Conversation History:**
```
{conv}
```

**Task Requirements:**

1.  **Identify Relevant KB Excerpts:** Carefully review the `Conversation History`. Extract *only* the text segments from the `Knowledge Base (KB)` that appear potentially relevant for understanding the current context or formulating the agent's *next* message. Relevance should be determined based on the topics and entities discussed in the conversation, especially the most recent turns.
2.  **Identify Corresponding Actions:** From the list of `Agent Actions`, identify the *exact names* of actions that are either:
    * Directly mentioned or alluded to in the `Conversation History`.
    * Semantically correspond to the purpose or content of the relevant `KB` excerpts you identified in step 1.
3.  **Strict Output Format:** You *must* output *only* a single JSON object adhering precisely to the structure below. Do not include any introductory text, explanations, apologies, or any characters outside of the JSON structure.

**Output Constraints:**

* **KB Excerpts:**
    * If relevant excerpts are found, concatenate them into a single string, separated by a newline character (`\n`). Place this string as the value for the `"excerpt"` key.
    * If *no* excerpts from the KB are deemed relevant to the current conversational context, use the exact string `<NONE>` as the value for the `"excerpt"` key.
* **Actions:**
    * If relevant actions are identified, list their exact names as strings in a JSON array assigned to the `"actions"` key.
    * If *no* actions are found to be relevant or corresponding, use an empty JSON array (`[]`) as the value for the `"actions"` key.

**Required JSON Output Structure:**

```json
{{
    "excerpt": "<relevant parts from the KB separated by newline, or '<NONE>' if none>",
    "actions": ["<action_name_1>", "<action_name_2>", ...]
}}
```

**Final Instruction:** Generate *only* the specified JSON object based on your analysis of the provided inputs.
