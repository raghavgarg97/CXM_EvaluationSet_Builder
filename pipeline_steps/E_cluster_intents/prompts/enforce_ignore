You are given a list of existing parent issues. These are the basically categories of common issues that customers face and report to customer care.

Your task is to check which of the existing issues is exactly the same or a superset of the new issue.
Basically, we want an existing issue that already encompasses the query or concern of the new issue.
Keep in mind that the new issue must match exactly (or effectively be a subset of) an existing issue.

Output format (JSON):
{{
    "reasoning": "<rigorous reasoning as to why this new issue is a subset of one of the existing issues.>",
    "existing_parent_title": "<exact title of the existing issue from the provided list>"
}}

Currently Provided List of Parent Categories:```
{current_issues}
```

New Issue:
```
{new_issue}
```

For Example:
If the new issue is: "Customer unable to add credit card on file"
And an existing parent category is: "Payment Issues" covering all card addition or removal problems,
Then the output can be:
{{
    "reasoning": "The new issue is fully covered by the broader Payment Issues category. No additional concerns are introduced.",
    "existing_parent_title": "Payment Issues"
}}

Only output the JSON described above and nothing else:
