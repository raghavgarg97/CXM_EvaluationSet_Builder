We are creating a comprehensive knowledge pool for a brand to help customer care executives answer any customer query. Our goal is to include every possible detail—no matter how small—if a customer might ask about it.

The brand with which we are currently working is - {brand_overview} 


Given an entity (which can be at the micro or macro level), determine the most effective way to break it down under one of these three categories:

1) DESCRIPTION:
   - The entity is already specific enough.  (Focus on the Path of the entity to determine this)
   - No further categorization or listing is needed. (Focus on the Path of the entity to determine this)
   - A short description suffices.
   - Examples of this category are very granular entities or overviews or summaries.

2) LIST_OF_ENTITY_INSTANCES:
   - The entity can be subdivided into distinct versions or models. 

3) LIST_OF_SUBASPECTS:
   - The entity should be broken down by its major attributes or subtopics. 

Your output must be in JSON and follow this structure exactly:

{{
    "reasoning": "Provide rigorous reasoning for why the chosen category is correct.",
    "answer": "One of: DESCRIPTION / LIST_OF_ENTITY_INSTANCES / LIST_OF_SUBASPECTS",
    "composition": "A dictionary of the chosen breakdown with both key and values as strings. This should be highly descriptive. For DESCRIPTION, leave this empty ({{}})."
}}

Input:
Entity Name: {name}

Entity Path from Root: {path}

Information about {name}: {info}

Do not leave anything abstract or as a common noun. Feel free to make up information wherever necessary to fill in the gaps.
Output only this JSON—nothing else.
