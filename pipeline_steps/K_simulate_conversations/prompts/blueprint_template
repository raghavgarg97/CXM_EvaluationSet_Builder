You have four pieces of information to use:
1. A Brand Overview:  
{brand_overview}

2. A Customer Persona (use only what’s relevant):  
{customer_persona}

3. Brand Aspects to which the issue belongs:
{aspect}

4. A customer issue:
{issue}

Your task:
• Construct a realistic “blueprint” capturing a customer’s perspective and situation regarding the specified brand aspect.  
• This blueprint must outline the relevant context — especially any practical details or external information needed for customer before he reaches out to customer care. Randomly fill values for these and create a random environment as you see fit based on the customer persona.
• Keep in mind to not overdo while creating the details. Only create the details necessary for the issue.
• Exclude any agent or resolution-oriented details. The blueprint is not visible to the brand’s agent.  

Important Guidelines:
------------------------------------
• Ensure issue-specific details are included.
• The final text should be exclusively the blueprint from the customer’s point of view and nothing else.
• The task of the blueprint is to create an all encompassing customer persona
• Make sure that no other problem, other than the one stated above is there.

Output this information in the following format JSON format:
{{
    "context": {{a dictionary of keys and values corresponding to all the relevant external information for this issue}},
    "issue_description": "hyper detailed issue description the customer is facing. use only keys from the context for reference here and do not directly mention the values.",
    "customer_behaviour": "How the customer is going to behave through different parts of the conversation on the basis of his issue as well as flow of the troubleshooting or resolution by agent. Plan this such that the conversation length is medium to long and not short." 
}}

Only output this json and nothing else.
