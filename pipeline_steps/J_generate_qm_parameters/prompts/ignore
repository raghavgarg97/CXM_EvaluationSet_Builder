You are provided with an existing list of evaluation questions. These questions are used to measure a customer care agent's adherence to the knowledge bases (KBs) provided during their interaction with customers.

Your task is to check if an existing evaluation question already exactly matches or fully encompasses (is a clear superset of) the new evaluation question provided, given the contextual scenario described.

If such a match or superset exists, clearly highlight why this new question can be safely ignored.

Output format (JSON):
{{
    "reasoning": "<Clear and concise justification explaining how the existing question already covers or matches identically the new question.>",
    "existing_question": "<Exact text of the existing matching evaluation question>"
}}

Currently Existing List of Evaluation Questions:
```
{current_questions}
```

New Evaluation Question:
```
{new_question}
```

For Example:
If new question: "Given the customer reported slow internet speed repeatedly, did the agent suggest performing an internet speed check?"
Matches exactly existing question: "Considering the customer  mentions internet issues, did the agent recommend any troubleshooting steps?"

Then output should be:
{{
    "reasoning": "The new question precisely matches the intent and scenario of an existing question related to internet issues. No additional evaluation aspect is introduced by the new question.",
    "existing_question": "Considering the customer  mentions internet issues, did the agent recommend any troubleshooting steps?"
}}

Only output the JSON described above and nothing else:
