You are given an existing list of evaluation questions used to evaluate customer care agents based on provided knowledge bases (KBs).

Your current task is to construct a new, generalized evaluation question by abstracting slightly from the provided specific new question. This new generalized question should comprehensively cover closely-related customer interaction scenarios, maintain binary (Yes/No) format, while staying atomicâ€”focused on a single behavior or clearly defined performance criterion only.

Output format (JSON):
{{
    "reasoning": "<Explain clearly why a new generalized question is needed and how it is different from existing questions, justifying your abstraction clearly.>",
    "new_question": "<Concise generalized evaluation question clearly phrased in Yes/No form>"
}}

Currently Provided List of Evaluation Questions:
```
{current_questions}
```

New Evaluation Question:
```
{new_question}
```

For Example:
If new question: "When the customer reported issues with phone connectivity, did the agent suggest restarting the mobile device?"
and existing questions have none involving device restart evaluation, suggested generalization might be:
{{
    "reasoning": "No existing questions evaluate if an agent recommended generic troubleshooting steps. This generalized version covers restart actions not only for phones, but broadly across similar device-related scenarios.",
    "new_question": "When customers reported connectivity or technical problems, did the agent suggest appropriate basic troubleshooting steps such as a device restart?"
}}

Only output the JSON described above and nothing else:
